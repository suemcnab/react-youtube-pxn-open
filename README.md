# react-youtube-pxn-open
Live search and play YouTube videos. The UI is created with ReactJS and explores using Semantic UI with React. I found myself using it a lot for research and having ideas to extend it into a more fully fledged application with user saved searches. It's just a bit of fun at the moment. It is not a production ready application, but it does include a dev server tool chain.


###Getting Started###
```
	> git clone https://github.com/suemcnab/react-youtube-pxn-open.git
	> cd react-youtube-pxn
	> npm install
	> commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
	> npm start
```


You must obtain your own API-key to use this.

Here is the outcome:
